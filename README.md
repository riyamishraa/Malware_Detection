Project Overview
This project involves creating a machine learning model to detect malware by analyzing various features of files or programs. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing both malware and benign samples. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in detecting malware while minimizing false positives.

Features
Preprocessing: Data cleaning and feature extraction from raw data.
Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms.
Evaluation: Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Graphical representation of results and metrics.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/riyamishraa/Malware_Detection.git
cd Malware_Detection
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the dataset: Ensure that the dataset is in the correct format and placed in the data/ directory.

Usage
To train the model, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
To evaluate the model on a test set, use:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
For additional options, refer to the command-line arguments in the respective scripts.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project should contain labeled samples of both benign and malware files. If using a public dataset, ensure you have the appropriate permissions and have cited the source.

Model Training
The model can be trained using various machine learning algorithms, including:

Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Neural Networks
Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are employed to optimize model performance.

Evaluation
The model is evaluated on a separate test set using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
These metrics help determine the effectiveness of the model in detecting malware.

Results
The current model achieves an accuracy of X% with a precision of Y% on the test set. Further improvements are being explored to enhance performance.
